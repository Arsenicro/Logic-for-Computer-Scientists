# Logic-for-Computer-Scientists

,Logic for Computer Scientists'' is one of the first mandatory classes that every computer science student at the University of Wrocław has to deal with. Although the subject is not difficult, it has been causing problems for students for many years. The fact that for many students logic is something completely different from the math they have learned in high school makes it difficult for them to master the starting material, and not understanding the first few topics makes it very difficult to understand the rest of the material. Consisting of a written part and an audiovisual part, the work is an attempt to create a guide that could help first-year students better cope with logic and, as a result, have a better chance of graduating from the University of Wrocław.
